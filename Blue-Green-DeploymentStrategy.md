### Blue-green deployment is a deployment strategy used in software development to release new versions of applications with minimal downtime and reduced risk. In this approach, two identical production environments are maintained, one representing the current live version (blue), and the other representing the new version to be deployed (green). By directing user traffic to one environment at a time, the strategy allows for seamless updates, thorough testing, and easy rollback if issues arise. This introduction sets the stage for understanding how blue-green deployment works and its benefits in ensuring a smooth and reliable release process for software applications.
