## kubernetes deprecated heapster

#### As of Kubernetes v1.11, Heapster was marked as deprecated in favor of the Kubernetes Metrics Server, which offers a more efficient and scalable solution for gathering resource metrics within Kubernetes clusters.
#### Here's a comparison between Heapster and Metrics Server, along with a diagram illustrating the deprecation:

### Heapster:

Heapster was initially developed as a monitoring and performance analysis tool for Kubernetes clusters. 
It collected various metrics such as CPU and memory usage from the Kubernetes API server, Kubelet, and cAdvisor, and stored them in a time-series database like InfluxDB or Google Cloud Monitoring.

**However, Heapster had several limitations and challenges:**

**Resource Intensive:** Heapster could impose significant overhead on clusters, especially in large-scale deployments, due to its architecture and resource consumption.

**Scalability Issues:** Scaling Heapster to handle large clusters with thousands of nodes and pods could be challenging and often required additional configurations or optimizations.

**Complex Setup:** Setting up and configuring Heapster, along with its dependencies like InfluxDB or Google Cloud Monitoring, could be complex and time-consuming.

**Limited Metrics:** Heapster provided basic resource metrics such as CPU and memory usage but lacked support for custom metrics and advanced monitoring features.

### Kubernetes Metrics Server:

In response to the limitations of Heapster, Kubernetes introduced the Metrics Server, a lightweight, scalable, and efficient solution for collecting resource metrics within Kubernetes clusters. The Metrics Server directly integrates with the Kubernetes API server and Kubelet to collect metrics, eliminating the need for additional components like Heapster and external databases.

### Advantages of Metrics Server over Heapster:

**Efficiency:** Metrics Server is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with minimal impact on cluster resources, making it suitable for large-scale deployments.

**Scalability:** Metrics Server scales seamlessly to handle clusters of any size, ensuring consistent performance and reliability.

**Simplicity:** Metrics Server simplifies the monitoring setup by eliminating the need for additional components like Heapster and external databases, reducing complexity and maintenance overhead.

**Compatibility:** Metrics Server is integrated directly into Kubernetes, making it the recommended solution for collecting resource metrics within Kubernetes clusters.

### Deprecation of Heapster:

#### Below is a simplified diagram illustrating the deprecation of Heapster in favor of the Kubernetes Metrics Server:

```

#### In this diagram, Kubernetes Metrics Server replaces Heapster as the primary solution for collecting resource metrics within Kubernetes clusters. 
#### Heapster is deprecated and no longer recommended for new deployments, with users encouraged to migrate to Metrics Server for improved performance, scalability, and simplicity.
