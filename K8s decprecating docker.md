# Kubernetes is Deprecating Docker?!
                  When people think of containers, they think of Docker and Kubernetes. Docker has been the big name when it comes to building and running containers, and Kubernetes has been the big name when it comes to managing and orchestrating them. It might seem a bit shocking to hear that Kubernetes is deprecating support for Docker as a container runtime starting with Kubernetes version 1.20.
