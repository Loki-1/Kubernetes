# Kubernetes is Deprecating Docker?!
#### When people think of containers, they think of Docker and Kubernetes. 
#### Docker has been the big name when it comes to building and running containers, and Kubernetes has been the big name when it comes to managing and orchestrating them. 
#### It might seem a bit shocking to hear that Kubernetes is deprecating support for Docker as a container runtime starting with Kubernetes version 1.20.

# What’s Changing with Docker?

### • Kubernetes deprecating Docker is actually not as big of a deal as it sounds.
#### Kubernetes is removing support for Docker as a container runtime. Kubernetes
#### does not actually handle the process of running containers on a machine. Instead, it relies on another piece of software called a container runtime.
